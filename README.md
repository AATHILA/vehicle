# vehicle

A new Flutter project.

Exercise: Develop a Flutter app to display a list of vehicles. Any vehicle that gives 15km/litre or above and 5-year-old or less is considered to be fuel efficient and low pollutant. This vehicle will have a green color coding. 15km/litre or above but older than 5 years will be fuel efficient, but moderately pollutant. These vehicles will have amber color coding. Everything else will be red colored.
